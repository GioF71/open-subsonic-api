## Changes

In the documentation all changes from the original Subsonic API will be emphasized with the following warning:

{{< alert color="warning" title="OpenSubsonic" >}}
Changes (Required or optional) related to OpenSubsonic.
{{< /alert >}}

All endpoints or responses modified by the OpenSubsonic API will have **[OS]** indicator in the navigation menu.

OpenSubsonic expand the original API via 3 different ways:

- **Clarifications**: Documentation improvement to ensure consistency in server answers or actions where doubt was possible.
- **Extensions**: Non breaking changes to the API to improve clients life. Like new returned field, or new parameters to existing functions.
- **Additions**: New endpoints added to provide functions that could not be provided via non breaking extensions.
