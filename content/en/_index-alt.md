# About the OpenSubsonic API

The OpenSubsonic API aims to enhance and improve the existing Subsonic API, which is a client-server API for music streaming. As the Subsonic project is no longer open-source software, the OpenSubsonic API is a community-driven effort to address various issues and limitations within the current Subsonic API.

## Goals

The OpenSubsonic API has several goals, which include:

- Being an open, collaboratively maintained specification.
- Ensuring security across all extensions.
- Maintaining complete backwards compatibility with the existing Subsonic API.
- Offering piecewise optional implementation for servers and clients.

## Collaborative Development

To foster a collaborative environment, the OpenSubsonic API development process involves:

- A GitHub organization for hosting the ongoing efforts of the group.
- A main repository that contains the Subsonic documentation and future enhancements.
- New proposals in the form of pull requests, which are discussed and require approval before merging.
- Organization membership open to interested client and server developers with published and available implementations.

## Addressing Issues with the Subsonic API

Some of the issues the OpenSubsonic API aims to address include:

- Outdated and insecure authentication methods.
- Suboptimal versioning schema.
- Insufficient methods for expressing server functionality.
- Lack of an open and collaborative way to evolve the API.

By extending the existing Subsonic API, the OpenSubsonic API hopes to create a more secure, flexible, and collaborative 
environment for the Subsonic ecosystem.
